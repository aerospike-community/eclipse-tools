<h1>User-Defined functions (UDFs)</h1>
A User Defined Function (UDF) is a piece of code, written by a user (or developer) in the Lua programming language that runs inside the Aerospike database server.  UDFs significantly extend the capability of the Aerospike Database engine both in terms of functionality and performance. 
In Aerospike, there are two types of UDFs:<p>
<ul>
	<li>Record UDF - is used to perform an operation on a single record.</li>
	<li>Stream UDF - is used for Real-time Aggregations, where a stream of records are produced from a query. 
	The stream may be Filtered, Transformed and Aggregated.</li>
</ul>

UDFs must be registered with a cluster before they are available for use.<p>
