<h1>Record UDF</h1>
A User Defined Function (UDF) is a piece of code, 
written by a user (or developer) in the Lua programming language that runs inside the Aerospike database server. 
UDFs significantly extend the capability of the Aerospike Database engine both in terms of functionality and performance. 
Record UDF operates on single record. Record UDF can be executed on result record set from other system feature like Scan / Query / Batch.<p>

<h2>Why would I use Record UDF ?</h2>
<h3>Performance</h3>

For large records with complex structure, pushing record read/write logic server side removes requirement of reading and writing entire record reducing network overhead
Moving the operation into the server via a UDF call, 
complex operation can be done under the umbrella of a single transaction, 
removing need for the "Compare and Set" (CAS) mode of operation.<p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

Using the basic types (string, number, byte array) and the collection types (list, map), 
virtually any complex data structure and function can be created with a UDF.


<h2>How Would I Use Them?</h2>
This section walks a developer through the steps to build and run a Record UDF against an Aerospike Server cluster.<p>

The following steps are involved:<p>

<ul>
	<li>Install and configure the server.</li>
	<li>Write a User-Defined Function (UDF)</li>
	<li>Register a UDF package</li>
	<li>Execute a command using the UDF</li>
	<li>Writing a Record UDF</li>
	<li>Write a UDF in the Lua programming language (http://www.lua.org/).</li> 
</ul>
